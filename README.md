Plain text:
During the website design process, utilizing Bootstrap was a rewarding experience, allowing us to appreciate the new skills we acquired. However, at times, it was challenging to achieve the desired design elements, necessitating consultation with more experienced programmers for guidance. The majority of the images used on the website were sourced from Splash image stock. I attempted to incorporate animations using the CSS library but found it more efficient to target specific animations rather than utilizing the library. The high-fidelity file posed limitations on making changes to the portfolio that I would have otherwise preferred to modify.
