Plain text:
During the website design process, utilizing Bootstrap was a rewarding experience, despite the challanges to maintain the structure of the main coloring through the pages.I appreciate the new skills we acquired comparing the previous projects. In addition to that, it was challenging to achieve the desired design elements, I tried to have some  advice from  experienced programmers peers for guidance. The majority of the images used on the websiteare originals, I couldn't finf in the free stock website without the watermark.
I attempted to incorporate animations using the CSS library but found it more efficient to target specific animations rather than utilizing the library. I targeted the heading of the portoflio with Jello animation and made visible once you visit the pages.
The site uses a publicly available CSS or JS library that is mostly includede in the Boostrap, in the head of the different HTMLs.
The high-fidelity file posed limitations on making changes to the portfolio that I would have otherwise preferred to modify. Howeve, I maintained the same shape.
